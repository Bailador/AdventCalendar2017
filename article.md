# Bailador (title ?)

It was six years ago. It was a long, long time ago.

Six years ago to the day, tadzik published an article in the 2011 Perl 6 Advent Calendar, entitled [«Bailador, a small Dancer clone »](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/bailador-a-small-dancer-clone/). Hundreds of lines of code and almost 700 commits later, Bailador is now anything but a Dancer clone.

Before having a quick look at Bailador itself, it's important you to keep in mind that even if Bailador is six years old, it is still at its beginning.
